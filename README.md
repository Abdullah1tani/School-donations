# School Donations

School Donations is an academic project for the course [SOEN 363: Data Systems for Software Engineers](https://www.concordia.ca/academics/undergraduate/calendar/current/section-71-gina-cody-school-of-engineering-and-computer-science/section-71-70-department-of-computer-science-and-software-engineering/section-71-70-10-computer-science-and-software-engineering-courses.html#3708). Worked in a team of 4 to create a PostgreSQL and a BigQuery database. 

## Introduction
The goal of this project is to test the efficiency of SQL (PostgreSQL) and NoSQL (BigQuery). We created two databases, a PostgreSQL database, and a BigQuery database, and used the same dataset for both of them.

## What is Big Query?
Google BigQuery has a good balance between availability and consistency. It is an enterprise data warehouse that:
- Helps manage and analyze data with built-in features
- Uses SQL queries
- Separates data from storage to maximize flexibility
You can find more about BigQuery [here](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery).
